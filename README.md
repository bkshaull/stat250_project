===============
The OriginalGA.m is the algorithm that I began with and the GAL_Nonlinearpricecompetitionprofitsonly.m is the final version of the genetic algorithm. 

The uperms Matlab function is needed to run the original genetic algorithm, and the nextperms mex file is needed to to run the final version.  Both should be put into the Matlab folder.

To compile the mex file, type "mex nextperms.cpp" into the command line in Matlab.  It should compile and then the function will work!
